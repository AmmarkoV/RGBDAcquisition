 * @brief do an atof while forcing local to US

 * depending on different conventions about floating point numbers from different countries
 * For example in france pi is written 3,14 and not 3.14 , that in turn made calibration files to be erroneously parsed
 * losing the fractional parts and becoming useless. internationalAtof enforces US locale so that we have a clear way to
 * save/load calibration files with no possible chances of failure between different systems with different locales.

 *      If someone wants to respect them he should consider setting RESPECT_LOCALES to 1 in calibration.c and recompiling everything
