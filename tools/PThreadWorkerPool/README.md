# PThreadWorkerPool

A header-only thread automization library to make your multithreaded-lives easier.

The header is [this](https://github.com/AmmarkoV/PThreadWorkerPool/blob/main/pthreadWorkerPool.h)

An example code that uses the library [is this](https://github.com/AmmarkoV/PThreadWorkerPool/blob/main/example.c)

You dont need anything (other than pthreads and a C compiler), just include the header on your code.

I have also added an example code snippet, to build it use 

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpthread-stubs0-dev

make

```
