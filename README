This is the RGBD project.. :P

If you want to download OpenNI , OpenNI2 , LibFreenect , please issue 
cd 3dparty && ./get_third_party_libs.sh


One very basic thing about setting up what you want is the acquisition/acquisition_setup.h file..
It controls what modules get linked during the compilation in order to keep your dependencies at a minimum..  Of course you will need the appropriate 3dparty libs if you enable a module that uses them.. 

To compile the library issue 

make


To test it issue 

./run_grabber.sh 10

You can select from the modules linked by using  them as a parameter..
For example
./run_grabber.sh 10 OPENNI1 will use the  OpenNI1 module
./run_grabber.sh 10 OPENNI2 will use the  OpenNI2 module
./run_grabber.sh 10 OPENGL will use the  OpenGL  module
./run_grabber.sh 10 FREENECT will use the  FREENECT module
