This is the RGBD project.. 

If you want to download OpenNI , OpenNI2 , LibFreenect , please issue 
cd 3dparty && ./get_third_party_libs.sh


One very basic thing about setting up what you want is the acquisition/acquisition_setup.h file..
It controls what modules get linked during the compilation in order to keep your dependencies at a minimum..  Of course you will need the appropriate 3dparty libs if you enable a module that uses them.. 

To compile the library issue 

make
there also exists a bash script called
./make.sh , you could use it if you run into problems


To test it issue 

./run_grabber.sh 10

You can select from the modules linked by using  them as a parameter..
For example
./run_grabber.sh 10 OPENNI1 outdir will use the  OpenNI1 module
./run_grabber.sh 10 OPENNI2 outdir will use the  OpenNI2 module
./run_grabber.sh 10 OPENGL outdir will use the  OpenGL  module
./run_grabber.sh 10 FREENECT outdir will use the  FREENECT module

outdir is converted to grabber/frames/outdir


Without beeing 100% certain OpenNI installed via ROS may conflict with it being downloaded as a standalone package
If you install sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-openni-camera ros-groovy-openni-launch  
If you want to use it you should initiate :

roscore 
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch &
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure 

After this OpenNI should be operational
